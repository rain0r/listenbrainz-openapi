  summary: |-
    Create a playlist. The playlist must be in JSPF format with MusicBrainz extensions, which is defined here: https://musicbrainz.org/doc/jspf . To create an empty playlist, you can send an empty playlist with only the title field filled out. If you would like to create a playlist populated with recordings, each of the track items in the playlist must have an identifier element that contains the MusicBrainz recording that includes the recording MBID.

    When creating a playlist, only the playlist title and the track identifier elements will be used - all other elements in the posted JSPF wil be ignored.

    If a created_for field is found and the user is not an approved playlist bot, then a 403 forbidden will be raised.
